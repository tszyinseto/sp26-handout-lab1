## (Answer before group discussion) Scoring System Rationale  

What are your housing priority scoring criteria? Why did you choose these weights? How do they reflect the goals of fairness, privacy, simplicity, or rewarding effort? Recall that the categories are:

- Class year (1=Freshman, 2=Sophomore, 3=Junior, 4=Senior)
- Graduation status (True/False)
- Credits earned
- Additional questions - what questions did you choose?

Describe your thought process here before the group discussion.

In my opinion, my housing priority scoring criteria could be related to the student's class year. For example, if the studnet is freshman/sophmore. They are more likely/get a higher score to get a spot of housing living on campus. 
For example :
Freshman year +4 points 
Sophomore year +3 points 
Junior year +2 points 
Senior year +1 point
Graduation status:
True -> +1 point False -> +2 points
Credits earned each credit -1 point
If they are international student, then +5 points
In-state student +1 point
Out-of-state student +3 points





## (Answer after group discussion) Similarities and Differences

1. Describe how your scoring system is similar to at least one other system. If there are none like yours, explain why.
The other person's scoring system is pretty similar to my system, we also try to get more new first year/second year student to live on campus as much as possible. So our questions are based on if the student is first/second year. Then the student will most likely to get more points.

2. Describe how your scoring system is different from at least one other system. If everyone in your group had the same system, please state that (after checking carefully that there really are no differences).
The other studnet's additional question is asking like if the student is athlete or not, if yes the student would get more points.
